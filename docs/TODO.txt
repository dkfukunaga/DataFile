x create specialized readArray and writeArray functions
x work on file extension functions
x move hexDump to DataFile
x add hexDump(start, size)
- add openReadOnly
    - add read_only flag and getter
    - implement read only checks for write functions
- add comments
- make some unit tests
    - check specific bytes in DataFile
    - check data fields in items read from DataFile
    - make sure to check all permutations of read/write functions
    - test for exceptions?
    - verify open/close working as intended
x start testing

- consider using <filesystem> to check file path and adjust to save test data to .\doctest\data
